    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this article, we are going to cover a simple, yet extremely versatile algorithm called k-nearest neighbors (k-NN).  First, we will build intuition about k-NN's inner workings and then learn how to apply the algorithm to real financial data from [AlphaWave Data](https://www.alphawavedata.com/).  We will use fundamental credit data of high yield and investment grade bonds as well as their corresponding credit ratings.  Using scikit-learn, we will experiment with ways to improve the predictive power of the algorithm through parameter optimization and pre-processing of the data.  Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.  Finally, we will implement k-NN from scratch to further solidify your understanding of this algorithm.\n",

    "So where does k-NN fit within the broader context of [machine learning](https://hdonnelly6.medium.com/list/machine-learning-for-investing-7f2690bb1826)?  Let's briefly review reinforcement, unsupervised, and supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions in order to achieve a specific goal or objective.  The most famous application of reinforcement learning was in 1997 when the IBM Deep Blue super computer defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, we are tasked with identifying patterns in data that is not labeled or classified.  Essentially, the goal is to study the structure of the data in order to extract useful information.  One example of unsupervised learning is [principal component analysis (PCA)](https://hdonnelly6.medium.com/machine-learning-for-esg-stock-trading-pca-and-clustering-ebe6077fc8f0), which is a technique for reducing dimensions in the data.  Another example of unsupervised learning is k-means clustering, which will be covered in a separate article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is applied when we want to map new input data to some output data.  In the context of classification, it will assign a label to some input data called X.  In a [regression](https://hdonnelly6.medium.com/introduction-to-machine-learning-regression-fee4200132f0), we map the input data X to some continuous output variable Y like in a single variant function, y = mx + b.\n",
    "\n",
    "So k-NN is an example of supervised learning because it relies on the label input data to learn a function which will then predict labels for the new unlabeled data.  We will see later that k-NN can be applied to both regressions and classifications.  Although, it tends to be used more frequently in classification."

    "So how does k-NN work?  Imagine we have two categories.  The first category is defined by the red triangle and the second category is defined by the blue square.  How would we classify the green circle that is in the middle?  If we only looked within the proximity of the solid circle, it would be reasonable to assume that our green circle belongs to the red triangle because within the solid circle there are two red triangles and there is only one blue square.  However if we looked beyond the solid circle to the dashed circle, then we would choose the blue square as the class for our green circle because we have three blue squares and two red triangles. Based on the majority voting of which class is most common, it is a reasonable assumption to make that the green circle belongs to the blue square class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that k refers to the number of nearest points to the point we are looking to categorize.  At its core, k-NN is one of the easiest algorithms in machine learning.  It uses previously labeled data for making new predictions on the unlabeled data based on some similarity measure, which is distance in this example.  The algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity.  In our example, we can see that the three points closest to the green circle lie within the solid circle.  Depending on the value of k, the algorithm will classify new samples by the majority vote of k neighbors."

    "The algorithm starts by classifying the distance of the green circle from all the points in the dataset labeled by the red triangles and blue squares.  We then sort the distances from the smallest to largest to find the k nearest points.  Finally, the algorithm assigns data to the class to which the majority of the k data points belong.  If you have k equal to 3, the green circle will be classified as a red triangle.  In a regression example where we predict the numerical value of the new sample, the k-NN algorithm will just take the mean of the k nearest neighbors."

    "This algorithm appears to be relatively easy, but how does one choose k?  In our triangle and square classification example, if we select k equal to 3 we classify the green circle as a red triangle.  However if we select k equal to 5, it will compel us to classify the green circle as a blue square.  The result of the algorithm is entirely dependent on the value of k.  Unfortunately, there is no defined answer when it comes to selecting k.  The optimal value of k will vary with every dataset. Our goal is to find the k that will optimize the accuracy of the algorithm or minimize the error.  Like in most machine learning algorithms, k is a hyperparameter so it is up to you to pick the value that results in the best possible fit for the data.  We will see how this is done in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of k as the tradeoff between bias and variance.  Bias is the difference between the average prediction of the model and the correct values we are attempting to predict.  With high bias, the model tends to be over simplified, whereas, the model tends to be more complex with low bias.  So, low bias will lead to overfitting.  For example, if we choose k equal to 1 in our k-NN algorithm, every new sample we would attempt to classify would be labeled as the closest neighbor because the number of neighbors is equal to 1.  If we select a very large number for k, the model would underfit because we are generalizing our prediction based on a significantly more number of neighbors around our test point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance, on the other hand, is the variability of the model's predictive power for a given data point.  Models with high variance will capture all the nuances of the training data but they will not generalize well on the new unlabeled test data.  In practice, we see high variance when the model performs very well on training data, but fails to achieve a good result on the test data.\n",

Since we are just looking around for the most similar points in the neighborhood, defined by k, and are using Euclidean distance, the magnitude of features, or the variables, that we feed into the model will have an impact on performance. So if features vary by magnitude, then the algorithm will be bias toward variables with higher magnitude. To remedy this issue, we need to transform our data.\n",

Standardization is another method that subtracts the mean from each value and divides this by the standard deviation of values. Normalization is also called Min-Max scaling, which is what we will use in this example."

This must be taken into consideration and is why preprocessing of features should be done before passing them to the algorithm.
