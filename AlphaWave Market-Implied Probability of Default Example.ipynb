    "The probability of default is the probability that a bond issuer will not meet its contractual obligations on schedule. Although the most common event of default is nonpayment leading to bankruptcy proceedings, the bond prospectus might identify other events of default, such as the failure to meet a different obligation or the violation of a financial covenant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we will determine the probability of default given corporate bond prices. The default probabilities that are reached in this exercise are called market-implied default probabilities. Historically, practitioners have focused on the one-year probability of default calculation. We know that over shorter horizons of one or two years firms are exposed to the credit cycle effect, while over longer horizons, the business cycle effect tends to have a lesser impact and the company’s capital structure becomes more important. This effect has made long-run risk levels less cyclical and more stable. Intuitively, default risk over a longer time period is less sensitive to the instantaneous default rates in the economy.  For this reason, we will focus on corporate bonds with one or two years until maturity to calculate the market-implied default probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will verify the accuracy of the market-implied default probabilities with the Standard & Poor’s Average One-Year Transition Rates For Global Corporates using historical data from 1981-2019.  This transition matrix shows the observed historical probabilities of a particular rating transitioning to another rating, including default, over the course of one year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate the market-implied default probabilities, we must first acquire the company's current bond prices. Using a short Selenium script that emulates a user's keystrokes and clicks in a browser as a means of navigating to FINRA's TRACE bond data, we can access the data needed to calculate the market-implied default probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example script. In case you do not have [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) installed, you can visit their respective links and download them using pip in your terminal. We will also need a chromedriver (the simulated chrome browser Selenium controls) and to download it using Python you can use the [webdriver-manager](https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/) package also found in PyPi.\n",

    "Credit ratings are used in the wholesale market for bonds issued by corporations and government entities as well as for asset-backed securities (ABS). The three major global credit rating agencies are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings. Each provides quality ratings for issuers as well as specific issues. These are ordinal ratings focusing on the probability of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "The credit rating agencies consider the expected loss given default by means of notching, which is an adjustment to the issuer rating to reflect the priority of claim for specific debt issues of that issuer and to reflect any subordination. The issuer rating is typically for senior unsecured debt. The rating on subordinated debt is then adjusted, or “notched,” by lowering it one or two levels—for instance, from A+ down to A or further down to A–. This inclusion of loss given default in addition to the probability of default explains why they are called “credit ratings” and not just “default ratings.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The rating agencies report transition matrices based on their historical data. We can verify the accuracy of the market-implied default probabilities with these rating agencies' transition matrices. Using the code below, we can obtain the Standard & Poor’s Average One-Year Transition Rates For Global Corporates using historical data from 1981-2019 to verify the market-implied default probabilities calculated earlier."

    "In the example above, the bond valuation techniques using a Risk-adjusted Discount Rate does a reasonably good job at estimating the market-implied default probabilities. We calculated the Expected Cash Flow at each period by adding the product of the Default Payout and the Probability of Default (P) with the product of the promised payment (Coupon Payments and repayment of Principal) and the probability of not defaulting (1-P). One reason for any differences between historical and market-implied default probabilities is that historical default probabilities do not include the default risk premium associated with uncertainty over the timing of possible default loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used here is very sensitive to the discount and Recovery Rates selected. We assume a flat government bond yield curve, but it could be upward or downward sloping. If the government bond yield curve was sloped, the discount rates would need to be calculated sequentially by a process known as “bootstrapping.” We also assume in this example that the Recovery Rate is 40%, but another possibility is to change the assumed Recovery Rate to either 30% or 60% of exposure. Another simplifying assumption is that recovery is instantaneous. In practice, lengthy time delays can occur between the event of default and eventual recovery of cash. Notice that we assume that the Recovery Rate applies to interest as well as principal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we assume that default occurs only on coupon payment dates and that default will not occur on date 0, the current date. Although we assumed the annual default probability is the same each year, this does not need to be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the assumptions made in this analysis, the market-implied probability of default model built here does a fairly good job at identifying risk of corporate defaults and may suffice for simply rank ordering firms by credit worthiness."

    "*Bayesian Pairs Trading using Corporate Supply Chain Data*<br>\n",
    "If you liked this article, you may enjoy AlphaWave Data's [Bayesian Pairs Trading using Corporate Supply Chain Data](https://medium.com/@hdonnelly6/bayesian-pairs-trading-using-corporate-supply-chain-data-8b96305686d) article.  Using the [AlphaWave Data Corporate Supply Chain API](https://rapidapi.com/alphawave/api/corporate-supply-chain/endpoints), we can get a list of suppliers and customers for a given stock symbol.  You can further filter this list of suppliers and customers using the two-stage FCFF valuation model discussed in [Stock Valuation Using Free Cash Flow to the Firm With Python](https://hdonnelly6.medium.com/stock-valuation-using-free-cash-flow-to-the-firm-with-python-9a2f0e8f308f) to get a grouping of good pairs trading candidates that are potentially misvalued.  A list of company tickers that have supply chain data is included at the bottom of the Jupyter Notebooks available on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e_SiiZn7WEW3OUNG-ftN3riPNjiz0M0C?usp=sharing) and [Github](https://github.com/AlphaWaveData/Jupyter-Notebooks/blob/master/AlphaWave%20Corporate%20Supply%20Chain%20API%20Example.ipynb), which could be a good list of tickers to run through the two-stage FCFF valuation model discussed further below.\n",
