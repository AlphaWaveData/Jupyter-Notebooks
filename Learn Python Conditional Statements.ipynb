    "When you write code, you are giving instructions to the computer. When you are completing a task in the real world, however, you don't just step through a sequence of instructions blindly. Depending on what else is going on, you will want to adapt your actions. The Python conditional allows you to encode these instructions so that the computer can dynamically adapt to the conditions around it. This is often referred to as <b>control flow</b>.\n",

    "- (optional) elif\n",
