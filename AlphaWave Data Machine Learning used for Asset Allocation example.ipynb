    "## Asset Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a quick overview of asset allocation. Asset owners are concerned with accumulating and maintaining the wealth needed to meet their needs and aspirations. In that endeavor, investment portfolios—including individuals’ portfolios and institutional funds—play important roles. Asset allocation is a strategic—and often a first or early—decision in portfolio construction. Because it holds that position, it is widely accepted as important and meriting careful attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, investment firms manage a group of portfolios and have particular outcomes or target dates assigned to each of these portfolios. To make sure these portfolios meet their assigned goals, there can be a strategic asset allocation associated with them. The strategic asset allocation decision determines return levels in which allocations are invested, irrespective of the degree of active management.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example of a portfolio with a strategic asset allocation is a portfolio with defined weightings for equity and fixed income asset classes.  The equity weighting may be allocated between U.S. equities and global equities while the fixed income weighting may be divided between Treasuries, corporate bonds, high-yield credit, and emerging market debt.  These weightings are usually quite fixed and are based on a long time horizon of historical returns and correlations. There may be other asset classes also considered in a portfolio with a strategic asset allocation, like commodities and derivatives. The portfolios are typically rebalanced periodically in order to maintain the same asset class exposure going forward in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we live in a world that changes quickly. As a result, some investment firms often employ a tactical asset allocation. This provides the portfolio with short-term tilts. There can be dynamic weightings, or put differently, migrations slightly away from the strategic asset allocation. The portfolio that uses a tactical asset allocation may focus on allocations within sub-asset classes. If you are working within the fixed income asset class, you may move your allocation away from Treasuries and short-term notes and towards a high-yield or emerging market credit allocation. The belief is that the portfolio is better able to outperform the market with these new asset allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To employ a tactical asset allocation, there are a few different approaches that can be taken. One of the simplest approaches is a discretionary one whereby portfolio managers and chief investment officers overweight or underweight particular assets within the portfolio based on their view of the business cycle. They often move within certain risk boundaries when changing portfolio weightings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another tactical asset allocation technique used is a momentum, trend following approach. With this, you look to capitalize on an asset class outperforming its peers in the next couple of rebalancing periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Litterman model is yet another tactical asset allocation approach. The model came out of Goldman Sachs research published in 1992 by Fischer Black and Robert Litterman. This model allows you to look at the historical returns, risk, and correlation of the assets in your portfolio. The user is only required to state how her assumptions about expected returns differ from the markets and to state her degree of confidence in the alternative assumptions. From this, the Black–Litterman method computes the desired (mean-variance efficient) asset allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Made famous more recently by the likes of AQR, risk parity has become a popular tactical asset allocation technique. The risk parity approach asserts that when asset allocations are adjusted (leveraged or deleveraged) to the same risk level, the risk parity portfolio can achieve a higher Sharpe ratio and can be more resistant to market downturns than the traditional portfolio. This is a slightly different approach in that you almost forget about forward forecasting returns.  Instead, you take the approach that you better understand where the risks lie in the portfolio and, as such, strive for an equal risk weighting among asset classes in the portfolio.  Essentially, you are focused on allocation of risk, usually defined as volatility, rather than allocation of capital. For example, if you had a 60% allocation to equities and a 40% allocation to fixed income in your portfolio, risk parity will likely force you to increase your allocation to fixed income as it is likely to have less risk than equities. Risk parity is vulnerable to significant shifts in correlation regimes in practice, such as observed in Q1 2020, which led to the significant underperformance of risk-parity funds in the Covid-19 sell-off."

It will train on five periods (monthly in this example) of returns in order to make a prediction of returns one month ahead.  The Multi-task Lasso model allows us to fit multiple regression problems jointly. This means the model will look at all features at the same time to predict all of the future returns.  For example, if we were analyzing stock A and stock B, the Multi-task Lasso model would not only look at the historical returns of stock A to predict the future returns for stock A.  Rather, the model looks at the historical returns for both Stock A and stock B in order to predict the future returns for stock A.\n",

If a coefficient is not important, it drops out of the model completely."
